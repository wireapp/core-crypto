# Human Changelog

This changelog is hand-written and is a more succinct description of what happened between releases.

Platform support legends:

* ✅ = tier 1 support. Things just work.
* ⚠️ = tier 2 support. Things compile but *might* not work as expected. Basically works but with papercuts
    * Note: the papercuts will majorly be with the build process. Things might be very rough to integrate as no polish at all has been given yet.
* ❌ = tier 3 support. It doesn't work just yet, but we plan to make it work.


## [0.3.0] - TBD

This second major release focuses on expanding our platform support and featureset

Platform support status:

* x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu ✅
* x86_64-apple-darwin ✅
* x86_64-pc-windows-msvc ❌
* armv7-linux-androideabi ✅ (⚠️)
* aarch64-linux-android ✅ (⚠️)
* i686-linux-android ✅ (⚠️)
* x86_64-linux-android ✅ (⚠️)
* aarch64-apple-ios ✅ (⚠️)
* aarch64-apple-ios-sim ✅ (⚠️)
* x86_64-apple-ios ✅ (⚠️)
* wasm32-unknown-unknown ✅

Note: all the platforms marked with (⚠️) above will get a round of polish for the build process & documentation in the next release.

### CoreCrypto

* Moved the codebase to `async`
    * This was a requirement to make everything work on the WASM target, as we cannot block the JavaScript runtime without making the browsers freeze up completely
    * As a consequence, we forked `openmls` to [wireapp/openmls](https://github.com/wireapp/openmls)
        * Our incremental changes, including the `async` rewrite of `openmls` is located [here](https://github.com/wireapp/openmls/pull/4)
* Added support for MLS Group Persistence, as this was preventing clients from continuing use of their joined groups (oops!)
* Added support for lifetime-expired Keypackage pruning
* Added support for external CSPRNG entropy pool seeding
* Dropped the `openmls-rust-crypto-provider` in favour of our `mls-crypto-provider` with support for more ciphersuites and updated dependencies
    * As a consequence, we forked `hpke-rs` to [wireapp/hpke-rs](https://github.com/wireapp/hpke-rs)
        * Our changes can be found [here](https://github.com/wireapp/hpke-rs/tree/fix/updated-deps)
* Majorly improved docs across all crates. Documentation for the `main` branch can be found here. The `HEAD` of this branch should only be a tagged version.
    * This documentation is available here: <https://wireapp.github.io/core-crypto/core_crypto/>
* Expanded the API to include:
    * Conversations:
        * Ability to wipe
        * Ability to leave
        * Ability to force clients to update their keying material (i.e. self-update)
    * Support for MLS proposals
    * Support for MLS external commits
        * Added support for joining a conversation via external commit
    * Support for MLS external Add and Remove Proposal support
    * Support for X.509 credentials
    * Added a commit delay hint to prevent clients from rushing to commit to the server - which would cause epoch conflicts and high load
* Changed most `message` fields to be named `commit`, as this would cause less confusion for consumers. Those fields always contained MLS commits and should be treated as such.

### FFI

* Added WASM bindings support to target `wasm32-unknown-unknown` as a new tier 1 target.
    * Added a full-fledged TypeScript wrapper with a full documentation to abstract the wasm-specific issues.
    * This now means that CoreCrypto is also now a NPM package. It is currently published at [@otak/core-crypto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@otak/core-crypto)
* Incremental improvements to the Kotlin & Swift UniFFI bindings
    * Caught up the bindings' API to match our internal CoreCrypto APIs
* Added a C-FFI for maybe future work involving other targets than Kotlin & Swift


### Keystore

* Added support for WASM through an AES-GCM256-encrypted IndexedDB backend
    * This introduced a major refactoring to structure the code around having different backends depending on the platform.
