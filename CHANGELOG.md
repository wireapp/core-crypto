# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- Removed `mlsInitWithClientId`, `mlsGenerateKeypairs`, `e2eiDumpPKIEnv`, `deleteKeypackages`

  Affected platforms: Web, Android, iOS

  Migration: not needed, no client is using these functions.

- Changed the location of the Wasm bytecode file

  Affected platforms: Web

  The Wasm bytecode file, `core-crypto-ffi_bg.wasm`, has been moved to a
  subdirectory named `autogenerated`. While this is an internal change
  and should normally not be breaking, in reality it may break the Web
  client, which assumes the location of that internal file.

  Migration: update relevant paths in the Web client to point to the new
  location, under `autogenerated`, including in any calls to `initWasmModule`.

- Added `encryptedMessage` field to `CommitBundle`

  Affected platforms: Web, Android, iOS

  This field is used to bundle encrypted history secrets with a commit that adds a new
  history client.

  Migration: update any pattern-matching or other code that depends on the structure of
  `MlsCommitBundle` to include the new field. Also, make sure to update your implementation of the
  `MlsTransport` protocol/interface to include this field in the payload sent to the Delivery Service.
- `ClientId` is a newtype, not a bare byte array.

  Affected platforms: Web

  Migration: call `new ClientId(id)` to construct a `ClientId`, and `id.as_bytes()` to get a byte array out.
- `ClientId` wrapper accepts a byte array, not a string.

  Affected platforms: Kotlin

  Migration: call `.toByteArray()` on the input.
- `CoreCryptoContext.exportSecretKey` (aka `CoreCryptoContext.deriveAvsSecret`) now returns a newtype

  Affected platforms: Web, Android, iOS

  Migration: call `.copyBytes()` on the newtype to get access to the raw byte vector.

  In the past, Android (but only Android) had a newtype; other clients needed to work with a raw byte vector.
  We've decided to expand the use of newtypes around byte vectors in the FFI interface. This has several benefits:

  - Increased consistency between client FFI libraries
  - Reduced thickness of the high-level FFI wrappers
  - In some cases (though not this one), we can avoid bidirectional data transfers across the FFI boundary, and just move pointers around instead.

### Features

- Support Android environments with 16k page size

## v7.0.1 - 2025-06-02

### Bug Fixes

- initWasm was being called with the wrong property field. (ca1706d)
- allow registering epoch observer before calling mls_init (3f0605a)

## v7.0.0 - 2025-05-21

### Breaking changes

The typescript bindings no longer implicitly load the wasm module when importing the core crypto module. To replace
this behaviour the `async initWasmModule()` function has been added, which must be called before any other core crypto
function.

### Features

- remove top level await and expose async init method instead (ce6e566)
- expose `historyClient` constructor to swift (22d98de)
- expose `historyClient` constructor to kotlin (b16839d)
- expose `historyClient` constructor to wasm (3c2531a)
- expose `history_client` constructor publicly (c24fcc3)
- restore history secrets (5643e87)
- add `fn history_client(HistorySecret) -> CoreCrypto` (8b7b7d4)
- add `fn generate_history_secret` (a998dec)

### Bug Fixes

- crypto-ffi: fix naming and attributes of WelcomeBundle fields on Wasm (1b2e88b)
- prevent cancellations during transactions (Kotlin) (75217d5)
- prevent cancellations during transactions (Kotlin) (ae621b7)

### Testing

## v6.0.1 - 2025-05-07

### Bug Fixes

- swift publishing CI action (d1030e1)

## v6.0.0 - 2025-05-07

### Highlights

- Changed the core crypto database key format, to enable validation of the same and ensure consistency between platforms
- Added a function for each platform to migrate from the old to the new key type
- Several more bug fixes, including prevention of the _pending commit_ error

### Breaking changes

- Changed the core crypto database key format

  Affected platforms: Web, Android, iOS

  Migration: before instantiating this version of core crypto for the first time, call `migrateDatabaseKeyTypeToBytes()`
  with the appropiate arguments (old key and your new key) _exactly once_.
  Then, instantiate core crypto with the new key.

  Note: Make sure the new key is not based on a string, and provide full 256 bits of entropy.

  Note: Instantiating this version of core crypto will fail before you call the migration function.

## v5.4.0 - 2025-05-14

### Highlights

Kotlin bindings only: transactions are now [`NonCancellable`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-non-cancellable/),
as [required by Uniffi](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/latest/futures.html#cancelling-async-code). This prevents a category of bug where Kotlin thinks a transaction
has been cancelled, while Rust thinks it is still running.

### Bug Fixes

- prevent cancellations during transactions (a28338fe)
- prevent cancellations during transactions (2fb8d979)

## v5.3.0- 2025-04-29

### Bug Fixes

- re-throw inner error which cancelled the transaction (Swift) (0c282b2)

## v5.2.0 - 2025-04-15

### Bug Fixes

- add registerEpochObserver to CoreCryptoProtocol (eadf388)
- create an interface for `ConversationConfiguration` (b1e82bf)
- swift publishing failing due to not running on latest macos runner (dcc1890)

## v5.1.0 - 2025-04-03

### Bug Fixes

- broken swift bindings by publishing uniffi framework separately (2b950cc)
- don't refer to the internal uniffi EpochObserver type in the public API (7833300)
- re-expose proteus_reload_session which removed by mistake (36f2b87)

## v5.0.0 - 2025-03-21

### Highlights

New Swift bindings which are more ergonomic and allows for better testing by exposing the transaction
context as a protocol.

New API for observing epoch changes through a callback API: `registerEpochObserver`. After adopting
this API clients can remove their own epoch observers.

### Breaking changes

* New Swift bindings are replacing the old Swift bindings.

### Features

- add API for observing epochs to the swift bindings (47f9a6e)
- [**breaking**] add Swift wrapper on top of uniffi (ce862d4)
- add `registerEpochObserver` helper in TS (1e25f4a)
- add `registerEpochObserver` helper in Kotlin (bc05e13)
- enable epoch observer registration in wasm (6a5f395)
- enable epoch observer registration in uniffi (e04b83e)
- relax `Debug` restriction on `EpochObserver` (ff22e35)
- add an `EpochObserver` trait and instance to the client (e83f9f5)

### Bug Fixes

- android-uniffi library namespace was conflicting the main android library (a7ec292)
- kotlin documentation links on the main page (8045031)
- release swift framework with correct version (f1c6029)
- the android artefact was still trying to publish to nexus (0b1dfeb)
- make `EpochObserver` and registration fn visible from the outside (b4a16f8)
- ensure that local epoch changes are also observed (bc43dc3)

### Documentation

- add note about logs in browser tests (bf6b594)

### Testing

- add test demonstrating epoch observer (a65ab45)
- add test for epoch observer behavior (c302cb3)
- add tests of basic behavior (a810259)
- don't assert a non-epoch-change when the epoch must change (d939255)
- rm `has_epoch_changed` usage in favor of `EpochObserver` (88cbff2)


## v4.2.3 - 2025-03-14

### Bug Fixes

- fix android publishing to maven central

## v4.2.2 - 2025-03-14

### Bug Fixes

- fix publishing to maven central

- update documentation table with links to docs for `v3.1.0` and `v4.2.0` (93bcba9)
- add docs landing page [WPB-11382] (5361146)

## v4.2.0 - 2025-02-28

### Highlights
 - The Android release once again bundles API docs.
 - The Kotlin bindings have received several API fixes in particular:
   - AcmeChallenge was missing the target property.
   - proteusGetPrekeyFingerprint was missing.
 - The Typescript bindings now correctly expose WireIdentity and X509Identity.
 - The code base has migrated to Rust 2024 edition.

### Bug Fixes

- expose target on AcmeChallenge (c509a3f)
- add missing proteus function (a956924)
- don't expose uniffi types in the kotlin bindings (988b7d0)
- publishing android docs (7b91f08)
- publicly expose WireIdentity and X509Identity in the typescript bindings (6592d4a)
- return the wasm bindgen generated JS type instead of converting the value to JSON. (3446920)

### Testing

- add test case for querying identities (3c36cb5)

## v4.1.0 - 2025-02-07

### Highlights

- Add the capability to handle the case where a proposal-referencing commit arrives before the proposals
it references.

### (Semi-) Breaking changes

- For the case mentioned above, the corresponding error type `BufferedCommit` has been added.
  - Depending on the error model, this can be a breaking change.

### Features

- implement commit buffering (3737e97)

### Testing

- add test case for the first part of 15810 (258aa23)

## v4.0.1 - 2025-02-05

### Features

- support entity derive for tables with hex ids (0bd3676)


## v4.0.0 - 2025-01-28

### Highlights

- All errors crossing the FFI boundary are now logged.
- An iOS client has been added to internal interop tests, which means we now
  test the entire FFI stack on iOS.
- A new interface for MLS transport has been added, allowing for a much simpler
  and more robust CoreCrypto API.
- Removal of a number of deprecated and unnecessary functions and types.
- Completely reworked internal error handling, to allow for more precise
  errors.
- A number of improvements to Kotlin and Javascript bindings, making the
  bindings more consistent.
- The `decode` tool gained support for decoding MLS messages.

### Breaking changes

- Deprecated functions on the `CoreCrypto` type that were automatically
  creating transactions have been removed.

  Affected platforms: Web, Android, iOS

  Migration: replace calls to functions on `CoreCrypto` with calls to
  corresponding functions on `CoreCryptoContext`, which is created when you
  explicitly create a transaction. Transactions have to be explicitly created
  now.

- The low-level uniffi-generated Kotlin bindings code is no longer publicly
  available. It should never have been used in application code directly.

  Affected platforms: Android

  Migration: make sure to use the Kotlin high-level API only.

- The Wasm bytecode generated by `wasm-bindgen` is now imported directly when
  importing the `corecrypto` module. This makes sure that the Wasm module is
  immediately initialised, without any additional steps. There is no need for
  the client app to know or handle the path to Wasm bytecode file.

  Additionally, it is now possible to use the same CoreCrypto module in both
  browser and non-browser contexts.

  Affected platforms: Web

  Migration: drop any references to `core-crypto-ffi_bg.wasm` and do not set
  the `wasmFilePath` argument to the `CoreCrypto.init` function -- it is no
  longer used. Additionally, make sure there is no special handling or separate
  hosting of the Wasm bytecode file. CoreCrypto release artifacts should be
  used without any changes.

- Validation callbacks, as well as related error variants, have been removed.

  Affected platforms: Web, Android, iOS

  Migration: remove all implementations of `authorize`, `userAuthorize` and
  `clientIsExistingGroupUser`, as well as calls to `CoreCrypto.setCallbacks`.

- The `MlsTransport` interface has been added. This is another milestone in
  the effort to simplify the public API and make it more robust.

  All client applications have to provide an implementation of the new
  interface, which comprises only two functions, `sendMessage` and
  `sendCommitBundle`.

  Affected platforms: Web, Android, iOS

  Migration: implement the `MlsTransport` interface and call
  `CoreCrypto.provideTransport` to make CoreCrypto use your implementation.

- Functions `CoreCrypto.wipe` and `CoreCrypto.unload` have been removed. They
  were not providing any value.

  Affected platforms: Web, Android, iOS

  Migration: drop calls to `wipe` and `unload`. Client applications wishing to
  make their keys and conversations inaccessible should remove the CoreCrypto
  database explicitly.

- The function `CoreCrypto.proteusLastErrorCode` has been removed. We now have
  Proteus error codes attached to errors that are emitted by CoreCrypto.

  Affected platforms: Web, Android, iOS

  Migration: drop calls to `proteusLastErrorCode` and instead check the returned
  error object.

- The functions `CoreCrypto.buildMetadata` and `CoreCrypto.version` have been
  moved to the module level. It is no longer required to create a `CoreCrypto`
  instance to call them.

  Affected platforms: Web

  Migration: use module-level `buildMetadata` and `version` functions.

- Several changes have been made to the E2EI API.

  The function `CoreCrypto.e2eiRotateAll` has been removed. Client applications
  should instead go over each conversation individually and call
  `CoreCrypto.e2eiRotate`.

  Two new functions have been added, `CoreCrypto.saveX509Credential` and
  `CoreCrypto.deleteStaleKeyPackages`. The former should be used after getting
  a new X509 credential, while the latter should be called after generating
  keypackages for the new credential and replacing the stale ones in the
  backend.

  Affected platforms: Web, Android, iOS

  Migration: replace calls to `e2eiRotateAll` with iterations over
  conversations, calling `e2eiRotate` on every conversation and checking for
  errors. Use `saveX509Credential` and `deleteStaleKeyPackages` as appropriate
  (more details in API documentation).

- The proposal API has been removed, simplifying the public API a great deal.
  This includes functions like `newProposal`, `newExternalProposal`,
  `clearPendingProposal`, `joinConversation` etc.

  Affected platforms: Web, Android, iOS

  Migration: drop all calls to removed functions as they are no longer
  necessary with the new MLS transport interface.

### Features

## v3.1.1 - 2025-04-15

- This release bumps the version of rusty-jwt-tools to 0.13.0, which includes
  additional end-to-end identity tests and test markers relevant to Bund.

## v3.1.0 - 2025-02-12

### Highlights

- Add a test case mimicking a real life bug ([WPB-15810]), demonstrating that in some cases it was possible to generate errors by swapping the ordering of two messages.
- Add a new layer of buffering to handle that situation.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Decrypting a message can now potentially return a `MlsError::Other` variant with the message
  >
  >> Incoming message is a commit for which we have not yet received all the proposals.
  >> Buffering until all proposals have arrived.
  >
  > Clients do not need to take any action in response to this message.
  > This error simply indicates that the commit has been buffered, and will be automatically unbuffered when possible.

  If the required proposal is never delivered, however, the client will eventually desync as the commit will never be processed. Clients should be on the lookout for this case and trigger their rejoin protocol in that event.

### Features

- implement commit buffering (e98f0a6)
- support entity derive for tables with hex ids (235730c)
- implement basic derive macro for entity trait [WPB-14952] (7add536)

### Testing

- add test case for the first part of 15810 (3b41175)

## v3.0.2 - 2025-01-31

### Highlights

- Fix a bug which could cause certain errors to generate spurious log lines of the form

    > Cannot build CoreCryptoError, falling back to standard Error! ctx: Incoming message is from an epoch too far in the future to buffer.

## v3.0.1 - 2025-01-27

### Highlights

- Emit info log with context when buffering, restoring, or clearing buffered messages

## v3.0.0 - 2024-12-11

### Highlights

- Fix the 'transaction in progress' error when there was an attempt to perform multiple transactions
  in parallel. This will no longer throw an error, instead the transactions will be queued and performed
  serially one after another.

### Breaking changes

- Added the missing MLS error case OrphanWelcome.

### Bug Fixes

- expose `OrphanWelcome` to clients [WPB-14954] (530b2e4)
- silence verbose logs when performing a transaction [WPB-14953] (b13553d)
- don't swallow transaction errors if they don't originate from the closure [WPB-14895] (124b8a7)
- wait for current transaction to finish when creating a new one [WPB-14895] (73b9d52)

### Testing

- parallel transactions are performed serially (ccc0b32)

## v2.0.0 - 2024-12-02

### Highlights

- The number of public errors has been reduced and simplified. It's no longer necessary to use the
  `proteus_last_error_code` function, since thrown error should contain all the information.
- The logger callback now includes an additional context parameter which contains additional context
  for a log event in the form of a JSON Object string.
- It's now possible to change the logger and log level at runtime (see `setLogLevel` and `setLogger`).

### Breaking changes

- Dropped support for `i686-linux-android` target.
- `CoreCryptoLogger` takes an additional `context` parameter.
- `CoreCryptoError` and its child errors have been refactored to reduce the amount of error we expose and provide explicit
   errors for Proteus errors. The errors we have removed will appear under the `Other` case.
   ```
   enum ProteusError {
       SessionNotFound,
       DuplicateMessage,
       RemoteIdentityChanged,
       Other(Int),
   }

   pub enum MlsError {
       ConversationAlreadyExists,
       DuplicateMessage,
       BufferedFutureMessage,
       WrongEpoch,
       MessageEpochTooOld,
       SelfCommitIgnored,
       UnmergedPendingGroup,
       StaleProposal,
       StaleCommit,
       Other(String)
   }
   ```

### Features

- include the message of the source error when bundling errors together [WPB-14614] (16bc6e6)
- refactor non-WASM error types (9d41c11)
- proteus error codes are `Option<u16>` not `u32` outside wasm also (52547a0)
- refactor WASM error types (31c860a)
- proteus error codes are `Option<u16>` not `u32` (838c1ce)
- add logging for following the changes in mls groups WPB-11544 (8cc0e7f)
