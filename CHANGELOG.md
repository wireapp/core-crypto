# Changelog

Platform support legends:

* ✅ = tier 1 support. Things just work.
* ⚠️ = tier 2 support. Things compile but *might* not work as expected. Basically works but with papercuts
    * Note: the papercuts will majorly be with the build process. Things might be very rough to integrate as no polish at all has been given yet.
* ❌ = tier 3 support. It doesn't work just yet, but we plan to make it work.

## [0.7.0-rc.4] - 2023-03-28

<details>
    <summary>git-conventional changelog</summary>

### Bug Fixes

- Use schnellru fork for GroupStore faillible inserts
- Fixed GroupStore memory limiter behavior

### Features

- Remove any transitive crate using ring. As a consequence supports EcDSA on WASM
- Copy/modify kotlin wrapper from Kalium ([#284](https://github.com/wireapp/core-crypto/issues/284))
- [**breaking**] Support creating a MLS client from an e2e identity certificate

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Appease clippy

</details>

* Updated UniFFI to 0.23
    * Might or might not contain breaking changes depending on your use case, please refer to [UniFFI's documentation](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
* Fixed a small bug in the new GroupStore internals that was a bit too eager in limiting memory usage
* **[BREAKING]**: Renamed the WASM `strongRefCount(): number` API to `isLocked(): boolean`.
    * This essentially hides the implementation details across the FFI and should minimize brittleness
* Removed our dependency on [ring](https://github.com/briansmith/ring), an external crypto library. It was mostly used for validating x509 certificates and crafting Certificate Signing Request
    * By removing `ring`, we now support the following MLS Ciphersuites using NIST elliptic curves / ECDSA on WASM:
        * `MLS_128_DHKEMP256_AES128GCM_SHA256_P256` (`0x0002`)
        * `MLS_256_DHKEMP384_AES256GCM_SHA384_P384` (`0x0007`)
* **[BREAKING]**: Overhauled parts of the E2EI implementation
      * Moved from a stateless API to a stateful one. As a consequence, methods have less parameters, less structs need to be exposed. All of this is wrapped under Rust's safe sync primitives in order to be able to perform the ACME enrollment in parallel.
      * The new API allows creating a MLS group from the enrollment process.
        * ~~`certificateResponse()`~~ has been removed
        * `e2eiMlsInit()` has been introduced and permits ending the enrollment flow and use the x509 certificate to initialize a MLS client.
      * `ClientId` is now a string as per [RFC8555](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555). It does not anymore require to be prefixed (by `impp:wireapp=`) and is exactly the same as the one used for MLS
      * X509 SAN URIs are now prefixed by `im:wireapp=` instead of `impp:wireapp=`
      * This release has been tested against a real OIDC provider ([Dex](https://dexidp.io/)), federating identity from a LDAP server. The OAuth2 flow used for testing is [Authorization Code with PKCE](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-proof-key-for-code-exchange-pkce)
      * Private key materials are now properly zeroized



## [0.7.0-rc.3] - 2023-03-16

<details>
    <summary>git-conventional changelog</summary>

### Bug Fixes

- Proteus auto prekey ids not incrementing

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Release v0.7.0-rc.3

</details>

* Fixed a bug where `proteus_new_prekey_auto` returning the same prekey ID in particular cases
    * In case of "gaps" in the prekey id sequence, the previous algorithm (using the number of prekeys stored) would return the same ID over and over. As a consequence, the same prekey id would be overwritten over and over.

- Bump webdriver version to 110

</details>

* **[BREAKING]** proteus_new_prekey_auto() now returns a tuple of (prekey_id, CBOR-serialized PreKeyBundle) for backend requirements
    * On bindings, this translates to a new struct ProteusAutoPrekeyBundle which contains two fields:
        * `id`: the proteus prekey id (`u16`)
        * `pkb`: the CBOR-serialized proteus PreKeyBundle
* **[BREAKING]** Added an API to mark subconversations as child of another one (`mark_conversation_as_child_of`)
    * This is breaking because this now allows us to provide the parent conversation's client list in the `client_is_existing_group_user` callback, which adds a new parameter to it
* **[BREAKING]** `wipe_conversation` is now automatically called when a commit removing the local client is recieved.
* **[BREAKING]** Huge internal change on how we cache MLS groups and Proteus sessions in memory
    * This affects some APIs that became async on the TS bindings
    * Our previous `HashMap`-based cache could grow indefinitely in the case of massive accounts with many, many groups/conversations, each containing a ton of clients. This replaces this memory store by a LRU cache having the following properties:
        * Limited by number of entries AND occupied memory
            * Defaults for memory: All the available system memory on other platforms / 100MB on WASM
            * Defaults for number of entries:
                * 100 MLS groups
                * 200 Proteus sessions
        * Flow for retrieving a value
            1. Check the LRU store if the value exists, if yes, it's promoted as MRU (Most Recently Used) and returned
            2. If not found, it might have been evicted, so we search the keystore
            3. If found in the keystore, the value is placed as MRU and returned
                * Special case: we evict the store as much as needed to fit the new MRU value in this case. This is designed to infaillible.
            5. If not found, we return a `None` value
    * This approach potentially allows to have an unlimited number of groups/sessions as long as a single item does not exceed the maximum memory limit.
    * As a consequence of the internal mutability requirements of the new map and the automatic keystore fetches, many if not all APIs are now `async`. This does not concern the Mobile FFI.
* **[BREAKING]** Because of Rust 1.68's release, CoreCrypto is now incompatible with Android NDK versions under 25.2 (the LTS version) and Android API level 24.
* **[BREAKING]** E2EI: The API is now compliant with RFC8555
    * Another change will come soon to be able to initialize a MLS client using the X509 certificate issued by the E2EI process
* Enabled the iOS WAL compatibility layer to prevent spurious background kills
* Added a WASM api to check the Arc strongref counter

### 0.6.0 Release changes

* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** E2EI solution API overhauled from pre-release versions
    * This was made to fix some incompatibilities between the DPoP RFC and our code; The API had to be changed as a consequence
    * Please refer to the following point to see the changes
* First stable version of Wire's end-to-end identity client library. It allows a MLS client to generate a x509 certificate proving possession of its userId, clientId and displayName for a given domain/backend. This certificate will later be used as a MLS credential in place of the only currently supported "basic" one which consists of a public key.
    * To generate such a certificate, use the `new_acme_enrollment` method on a partially initialized CoreCrypto instance. This will generate a temporary key material for the enrollment session with the ACME server. Note that only Ed25519 signature scheme is supported at the moment.
    * Only the "enrollment" flow is defined for the moment. Later on, "refresh" and "revocation" flows will be added.
    * This library is heavily opinionated and only suited for **Wire** custom flow, with [our fork of the acme server](https://github.com/wireapp/smallstep-certificates). Any attempt to use it as a generic purpose acme client library will fail terribly.
    * To make sure this works as expected, this library has been tested against the actual [acme-server](https://github.com/wireapp/smallstep-certificates) thanks to [testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/). Only the OIDC provider has been mocked for the moment due to the fact that the target provider [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex) does not yet support Ed25519 signatures.

### 0.6.0 pre-release changes tl;dr, for information

#### Changes

* Added support for externally-generated MLS clients
    * This allows you to generate a standalone Credential/KeyPair, submit it to your MLS Authentication Service, and then update this credential with a newly-attributed Client ID.
* Added APIs to support Proteus Last Resort Prekeys
* Added support for Proteus error codes
    * WASM:
        * all errors are now instances of `CoreCryptoError` which extends the standard JavaScript `Error` but with additional properties:
            * `rustStackTrace` contains the original Rust error string.
            * `proteusErrorCode` contains the error code for Proteus calls. If it's 0, no error, otherwise it contains the code
        * WASM/TS now has access to the `CoreCrypto.proteusLastErrorCode()` method which allows to retrieve the last-occured proteus error and thus brings it to parity with other FFIs
    * On other platforms, the FFI has gained a `proteus_last_error_code` method.
* Fixed a bug where the keystore would not execute its IndexedDB upgrade handler on WASM, leading to older stores and/or new tables not being structurally consistent
* Added missing Proteus APIs to bindings and FFI:
    * `proteus_new_prekey_auto`: generates a new PreKeyBundle with an automatically incremented ID
        * To do this, CoreCrypto finds the first "free" ID within the `0..u16::MAX - 1` range and creates a PreKey using this ID.
* Added Proteus compatibility layer support
* Added API to export secret key derived from the group and client ids from the members
* Change `DecryptedMessage` signature
    * The `decrypt` API now returns if the decrypted message changed the epoch through the `hasEpochChanged` field
* Members can now rejoin group by external commits
    * Validate received external commits
    * Added `clear_pending_group_from_external_commit`
    * External commit returns a bundle containing the PGS


#### Breaking changes


* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Changed callbacks to be async
    * This allows consumers to perform async I/O within the callbacks
    * **Note** this doesn't affect the Kotlin/Swift bindings as UniFFI does not support async yet.
* **BREAKING** Renamed callback `client_id_belongs_to_one_of` to `client_is_existing_group_user`
* **BREAKING** WASM: Omitted in last build; `CoreCrypto.deferredInit` now takes an object with the parameters much like `init()` for consistency reasons.
* **BREAKING** No one was probably using it, but the C-FFI has been removed


There has been an extensive pre-release period (with many -pre and -rc releases), the original changelog for those has been collapsed below:

<details>
    <summary>0.6.0 pre-releases changelog</summary>

## [0.6.0-rc.8] - 2023-02-09

<details>
    <summary>git-conventional changelog</summary>

### Features

- Added support for Proteus Last Resort PreKeys (boooo!)
- [**breaking**] Async callbacks
- Externally-generated clients

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Release v0.6.0-rc.8
- Updated webdriver version to chrome 110

</details>

* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Changed callbacks to be async
    * This allows consumers to perform async I/O within the callbacks
    * **Note** this doesn't affect the Kotlin/Swift bindings as UniFFI does not support async yet.
* Added APIs to support Proteus Last Resort Prekeys

## [0.6.0-rc.7] - 2023-02-06

<details>
    <summary>git-conventional changelog</summary>

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed E2E interop test for breaking api changes
- New e2eidentityerror enum member wasn't exposed over ffi
- TS/WASM build issues & test

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Release v0.6.0-rc.7

</details>

* Fixed WASM build when imported from the outside
    * Made sure we're not leaking internal/private interfaces anymore and causing issues
    * Also added a test to our JS E2E suite to make sure importing the package with TS is successful and we do not encounter regressions like these anymore
* **BREAKING** WASM: Omitted in last build; `CoreCrypto.deferredInit` now takes an object with the parameters much like `init()` for consistency reasons.


## [0.6.0-rc.6] - 2023-02-01

<details>
    <summary>git-conventional changelog</summary>

### Bug Fixes

- Proteus error system not working (at all)
- Force cargo to use git cli to avoid intermittent CI failures

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Release v0.6.0-rc.6
- Updated rstest_reuse to 0.5
- Updated spinoff to 0.7
- Added codecov settings
- Update node to LTS 18 & enable JS e2e testing
- Make npm build run wasm-opt in Os
- Update JVM publish workflow to build on native platforms ([#229](https://github.com/wireapp/core-crypto/issues/229))

</details>

**IMPORTANT: The previous release (0.6.0-rc.5) is non-functional in general. The proteus error reporting does NOT work**

There's a post mortem available here: <https://github.com/wireapp/core-crypto/pull/230#issue-1557053094>

* Fixed support for Proteus error codes
    * WASM:
        * all errors are now instances of `CoreCryptoError` which extends the standard JavaScript `Error` but with additional properties:
            * `rustStackTrace` contains the original Rust error string.
            * `proteusErrorCode` contains the error code for Proteus calls. If it's 0, no error, otherwise it contains the code
        * WASM/TS now has access to the `CoreCrypto.proteusLastErrorCode()` method which allows to retrieve the last-occured proteus error and thus brings it to parity with other FFIs
    * On other platforms, the API is unchanged, but now works.


## [0.6.0-rc.5] - 2023-01-25

<details>
    <summary>git-conventional changelog</summary>

### Bug Fixes

- [**breaking**] Added conversation id to clientIsExistingGroupUser callback
- Increment IndexedDB store version when crate version changes

### Features

- Added support for Proteus error codes

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Cut release 0.6.0-rc.5
- Moved codecov from tarpaulin to llvm-cov
- Updated RustCrypto primitives & git dep in xtask

</details>

* **BREAKING**: Changed the signature of the `client_is_existing_group_user` callback to add the group id as the first argument
    * Before: `client_is_existing_group_user(client_id: ClientId, existing_clients: Vec<ClientId>) -> bool`
    * After: `client_is_existing_group_user(conversation_id: ConversationId, client_id: ClientId, existing_clients: Vec<ClientId>) -> bool`
* Added support for Proteus error codes
    * On WASM, the JS Error contains a `proteusError` method that returns the error code as an integer. If there's no error it returns 0.
    * On other platforms, the FFI has gained a `proteus_last_error_code` method.
* Fixed a bug where the keystore would not execute its IndexedDB upgrade handler on WASM, leading to older stores and/or new tables not being structurally consistent
* Updated RustCrypto dependencies
* Tooling: moved code coverage CI from Tarpaulin to LLVM-Cov
    * This lowered the execution time of our codecov CI from ~25-30 minutes down to ~15-20 minutes
    * This leads to more accurate code coverage as well - along with some false negatives such as `#[derive]` statements


## [0.6.0-rc.4] - 2023-01-20

<details>
    <summary>git-conventional changelog</summary>

</details>

* First bytes of end to end identity exposed. Thanks to the ACME protocol, it allows requesting a x509 certificate from an authority and then use it to create a MLS Credential.
* Fixed `cargo-make` Makefile.toml to allow building JVM bindings whatever the platform you're running
    * This is done by adding tests to the relevant tasks, allowing to conditionally execute them.
* Added a Makefile task to build the `core_crypto_ffi` Kotlin binding docs (via Dokka) and integrate them into the doc package
* Updated UniFFI to 0.22
* Other minor improvements on internal build/release tools (mainly our `cargo xtask` command)
* **Semi-breaking**: Behavior change on `ProteusCentral::import_cryptobox` (aka Cryptobox import).
    * WASM: If the provided store `path` is missing or doesn't have the expected tables, we now throw a `CryptoboxMigrationError::ProvidedPathDoesNotExist` error
    * Other platforms: If the provided cryptobox folder at `path` is missing, we now throw a `CryptoboxMigrationError::ProvidedPathDoesNotExist` error
    * Likewise, on all platforms, if the Cryptobox Identity is not present, we now throw a `CryptoboxMigrationError::IdentityNotFound` error and abort the process
* Tooling: Added a custom WASM test runner based on WebDriver (BiDi interactive test progress reporting in progress still)

## [0.6.0-rc.3] - 2022-12-15

<details>
    <summary>git-conventional changelog</summary>

### Bug Fixes

- Added missing Proteus APIs and docs

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Release v0.6.0-rc.3

</details>

* Added missing Proteus APIs to bindings and FFI:
    * `proteus_new_prekey_auto`: generates a new PreKeyBundle with an automatically incremented ID
        * To do this, CoreCrypto finds the first "free" ID within the `0..u16::MAX` range and creates a PreKey using this ID.
* Added missing documentation when it comes to Proteus eager Session persistence.
    * Previously undocumented change, but since `0.6.0-rc.1`, CoreCrypto eagerly persists Proteus Sessions (much like it does with MLS groups) when needed:
        * Decrypting or Encrypting messages, as ratcheting key material can be produced and as such must be persisted
            * We'll add a more "manual" API later on if you want to control when data is persisted (because it is performance heavy)
        * Initializing Sessions through PreKeyBundles or incoming Messages

<details>
    <summary>git-conventional changelog</summary>

### Bug Fixes

- Wire-server sends a base64 encoded ed25519 key afterall. Consumers are in charge of base64 decoding it and pass it to core-crypto
- TS Ciphersuite enum not correctly exported

### Documentation

- Add installation instructions for e2e runner on macos

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Release v0.5.2

</details>

to base64 decode the key and supply it to core-crypto
* Fix: Typescript enumerations could not be used by value

## [0.5.1] - 2022-21-09

<details>
    <summary>git-conventional changelog</summary>

* wasm32-unknown-unknown ✅

Note: all the platforms marked with (⚠️) above will get a round of polish for the build process & documentation in the next release.

* **[BREAKING]**: `commit_pending_proposals` now returns an optional `CommitBundle`
    * This was made to handle the case where there are no queued proposals to commit and this method would be called, causing the operation to fail.
* **[BREAKING]**: Changed the API for callbacks for clarity
    * This also contains documentation changes that make the use and intent of callbacks easier to understand.
* Fixed the iOS-specific database salt handling to allow using several databases on the same device.
* TypeScript bindings:
    * Removed the use of ES2020-specific operators (`??` Null-coalescing operator) to allow downstream to compile without transpiling.
    * Added callbacks API
    * Removed the usage of `wee_alloc` allocator as it leaks memory: https://github.com/rustwasm/wee_alloc/issues/106
* Kotlin & Swift bindings:
    * Upgraded UniFFI to 0.20 which now generates a correct callback interface in `camelCase` instead of erroneous `snake_case`.
        * Note that you will have to adapt to the aforementioned breaking changes to the callback API anyway so this just makes it a bit nicer

## [0.4.2] - 2022-09-05

<details>

- [**breaking**] 'decrypt_message' returns the sender client id
- Use 128 bytes of padding when encrypting messages instead of 16 previously
- Add function to return current epoch of a group [CL-80] ([#96](https://github.com/wireapp/core-crypto/issues/96))
- Adding a wrapper for the swift API and initial docs [CL-62] ([#89](https://github.com/wireapp/core-crypto/issues/89))
- Add '#[durable]' macro to verify the method is tolerant to crashes and persists the MLS group in keystore
- Expose 'clear_pending_commit' method

</details>

Platform support status:

* x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu ✅
* x86_64-apple-darwin ✅
* x86_64-pc-windows-msvc ❌
* armv7-linux-androideabi ✅ (⚠️)
* aarch64-linux-android ✅ (⚠️)

* aarch64-apple-ios ✅
* aarch64-apple-ios-sim ✅
* x86_64-apple-ios ✅
* wasm32-unknown-unknown ✅

Note: all the platforms marked with (⚠️) above will get a round of polish for the build process & documentation in the next release.

### CoreCrypto

* Allow rollbacking proposals. Now every method for creating a proposal also returns a proposal reference
(unique identifier) one can use later on to `clear_pending_proposal`
* Add `clear_pending_proposal` to wipe out local pending proposals
* Add `clear_pending_commit` to wipe out local pending commit
* Add `conversation_epoch` to get the current conversation's MLS epoch
* Now `decrypt_message` returns the sender client_id when the message is an application message. To use in calling.
* Durability: Now all the mutable operations are checked for durability i.e. would a process crash turn the application
into an inconsistent state. It boils down to verifying that we persist the MLS group in the keystore after every
operation mutating it
* Added a clean and documented Swift wrapper and tasks to build it more easily
* use 128 bytes of padding when encrypting messages instead of 16 previously
* Add some commit methods `final_add_clients_to_conversation`, `final_remove_clients_from_conversation`,
`final_update_keying_material` & `final_commit_pending_proposals` which return a TLS serialized CommitBundle. It cannot
be used now since wire-server does not yet have an endpoint for supplying it. It can be used to test the endpoint.
In the end, the `final_` prefix will removed and the not prefixed methods will be deprecated.
* Benchmarks have been improved and now also cover MLS operations

This second major release focuses on expanding our platform support and featureset

Platform support status:

* x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu ✅
* x86_64-apple-darwin ✅
* x86_64-pc-windows-msvc ❌
* armv7-linux-androideabi ✅ (⚠️)
* aarch64-linux-android ✅ (⚠️)
* i686-linux-android ✅ (⚠️)
* x86_64-linux-android ✅ (⚠️)
* aarch64-apple-ios ✅ (⚠️)
* aarch64-apple-ios-sim ✅ (⚠️)
* x86_64-apple-ios ✅ (⚠️)
* wasm32-unknown-unknown ✅

Note: all the platforms marked with (⚠️) above will get a round of polish for the build process & documentation in the next release.

### CoreCrypto

* Majorly improved documentation across all crates. Documentation for the `main` branch can be found here. The `HEAD` of this branch should only be a tagged version.
    * This documentation is available here: <https://wireapp.github.io/core-crypto/core_crypto/>
* Moved the codebase to `async`
    * This was a requirement to make everything work on the WASM target, as we cannot block the JavaScript runtime without making the browsers freeze up completely
    * As a consequence, we forked `openmls` to [wireapp/openmls](https://github.com/wireapp/openmls)
        * Our incremental changes, including the `async` rewrite of `openmls` is located [here](https://github.com/wireapp/openmls/pull/4)
* Added support for MLS Group Persistence, as this was preventing clients from continuing use of their joined groups (oops!)
* **All methods creating a commit e.g. `add_clients_to_conversation` now require to call `commit_accepted` when Delivery Service responds `200 OK`. Otherwise, it might indicate there was a `409 CONFLICT`, i.e. another client sent a commit for current epoch before and got accepted. In that case, do nothing and let things get reconciled in `decrypt_message`**
* Added support for lifetime-expired Keypackage pruning
* Added support for external CSPRNG entropy pool seeding
* Dropped the `openmls-rust-crypto-provider` in favour of our `mls-crypto-provider` with support for more ciphersuites and updated dependencies
    * As a consequence, we forked `hpke-rs` to [wireapp/hpke-rs](https://github.com/wireapp/hpke-rs)
        * Our changes can be found [here](https://github.com/wireapp/hpke-rs/tree/fix/updated-deps)
    * Ciphersuite support details:
        * `MLS_128_DHKEMX25519_AES128GCM_SHA256_Ed25519` ✅
        * `MLS_128_DHKEMP256_AES128GCM_SHA256_P256` ✅
        * `MLS_128_DHKEMX25519_CHACHA20POLY1305_SHA256_Ed25519` ✅
        * `MLS_256_DHKEMX448_AES256GCM_SHA512_Ed448` ❌
            * There is no suitable `ed448` rust crate yet
        * `MLS_256_DHKEMP521_AES256GCM_SHA512_P521` ❌
            * `p521` RustCrypto crate is a WIP and not ready just yet. It shouldn't take too long though.
        * `MLS_256_DHKEMX448_CHACHA20POLY1305_SHA512_Ed448` ❌
            * There is no suitable `ed448` rust crate yet
        * `MLS_256_DHKEMP384_AES256GCM_SHA384_P384` ✅

* Expanded the API to include:
    * Conversations:
        * Ability to wipe
        * Ability to leave
        * Ability to force clients to update their keying material (i.e. self-update)
    * Support for MLS proposals
        * Exposed methods to create `Add` / `Remove` / `Update` proposals
    * Support for MLS external commits
        * Added ability to export MLS Public Group State for a given conversation
            * A `PublicGroupState` is also returned everytime you create a commit. This comes from the need to keep the MLS Delivery Service up to date on the `PublicGroupState` so that external commits can be made by other clients.
        * Added support for creating an external commit to join a conversation (`join_by_external_commit`)
    * Support for MLS external Add (`new_external_add_proposal`) and Remove Proposal (`new_external_remove_proposal`).
    * Support for X.509 credentials
    * Added a commit delay hint to prevent clients from rushing to commit to the server - which would cause epoch conflicts and high load
        * Returned in `decrypt_message`
* Changed most `message` fields to be named `commit`, as this would cause less confusion for consumers. Those fields always contained MLS commits and should be treated as such.
* All commit methods now return a `CommitBundle` struct containing
      * the commit message
      * an optional `Welcome` if there were pending add proposals
      * a `PublicGroupState` to upload to the Delivery Service
    * `decrypt_message` now returns a `DecryptedMessage` struct containing:
      * an optional application message
      * optional pending proposals renewed for next epoch to fan out
      * a `is_active` boolean indicating if the decrypted commit message caused the client to be removed from the group
      * the aforementioned commit delay

### FFI

* Added WASM bindings support to target `wasm32-unknown-unknown` as a new tier 1 target.
    * Added a full-fledged TypeScript wrapper with a full documentation to abstract the wasm-specific issues.
    * This now means that CoreCrypto is also now a NPM package. It is currently published at [@otak/core-crypto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@otak/core-crypto)
* Incremental improvements to the Kotlin & Swift UniFFI bindings
    * Caught up the bindings' API to match our internal CoreCrypto APIs
* Added a C-FFI for maybe future work involving other targets than Kotlin & Swift


### Keystore

* Added support for WASM through an AES-GCM256-encrypted IndexedDB backend
    * This introduced a major refactoring to structure the code around having different backends depending on the platform.
