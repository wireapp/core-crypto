## Usage

### [API Docs](https://wireapp.github.io/core-crypto/)

## Building

### General Requirements

- rust: <https://rustup.rs/>
- GNU make: <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/> (min version: 4.3)

If you're using macOS, you'll also need to install GNU sed:

```sh,ignore
brew install gnu-sed make
```

and add aliases to your shell configuration file: `alias sed=gsed`, `aliase make=gmake` (e.g. to `~/.zshenv` if you're using zsh).

#### Pre-commit

- Install the [`pre-commit` framework](https://pre-commit.com/)
- Run `pre-commit install` to initialize the pre-commit hooks

### Android

[Install Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio) and Build-Tools for API level 30+

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are building on macOS you'll need to setup `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` path variable manually:
>
> ```ignore
> export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=~/Android/Sdk
> ```

[Install the Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk)

Install android rust targets:

```ignore
rustup target add x86_64-linux-android aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi
```

Build:

```ignore
make android
```

### iOS

Install Xcode & its command-line tools: [https://developer.apple.com/xcode/](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

Install iOS rust targets:

```ignore
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim
```

Build:

```ignore
make ios
# Additionally, if you want to export a .XCFramework:
make ios-create-xcframework
```

### MacOS

Install macOS rust targets:

```ignore
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### Linux

> [!NOTE]
> If cross-compiling from macOS, you'll need to install
> [https://github.com/messense/homebrew-macos-cross-toolchains](https://github.com/messense/homebrew-macos-cross-toolchains).

Install Linux targets:

```ignore
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### WASM

Make sure you have all prerequisites:

- Install [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/)
- Install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` toolchain: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- Install node.js (recommended way is via [Volta](https://volta.sh/))
- Install Bun (follow the instructions on [Bun's website](https://bun.sh/))
- Install wasm-bindgen-cli

Build:

```ignore
make ts
```

### Bindings

Build bindings for Android, JVM, iOS and WASM

```ignore
# builds bindings and targets for the JVM (macOS / Linux)
make jvm

# builds bindings and targets for Android
make android

# builds iOS framework
make ios-create-xcframework

# builds wasm binary & TS bindings
make ts
```

## Testing

### General testing

```ignore
# Install cargo-nextest if you haven't done so, it yields some substantial speedup
cargo install cargo-nextest
cargo nextest run
```

### Run core crypto internal tests on WASM target

If you haven't already, install the target and wasm-pack:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-pack
```

If you want to test for chrome, [get chromedriver](https://getwebdriver.com/chromedriver) or the webdriver for the
browser you want to test for, respectively.

Then, to run tests for a crate in the workspace do

```ignore
wasm-pack test --headless --chrome ./<crate-folder-to-test>
```

#### Addendum: testing all ciphersuites

> [!WARNING]
> This takes quite a while.

```ignore
cargo nextest run --features test-all-cipher
```

### Platform-specific tests for Kotlin/JVM

```sh
make jvm-test
```

### Platform-specific tests for Android

```sh
make android-test
```

### Swift/iOS

*No E2E testing is available as of now on Swift.*

### Platform-specific tests for WASM/Web

```sh
make ts-test
```

Note the `CC_TEST_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. At 1 it emits browser console logs; at 2 it also emits CoreCrypto logs.

## Benchmarks

There are benches implemented in [`crypto/benches`](crypto/benches/) for several operations on mls groups with varying sizes or proteus.
Parameters like minimum or maximum group sizes and step sizes are defined in [`crypto/benches/utils/mod.rs`](crypto/benches/utils/mod.rs).

### Executing Benches

To execute the benches, e.g. for creating commits, run

```bash
cargo bench --bench=commit -- --quick
```

where `commit` is the name of the bench specified in [`crypto/Cargo.toml`](crypto/Cargo.toml), and the corresponding file in [`crypto/benches`](crypto/benches/).
In case you're interested in higher accuracy, and willing to trade it for execution speed, omit the `--quick` flag.
If you need reporting plots, remove the `.without_plots()` call in [`crypto/benches/utils/mod.rs`](crypto/benches/utils/mod.rs).
The reports generated by criterion will be located in `target/criterion`.

## Git workflow

- The `main` branch is used as the everyday development branch.
- No merge commits. Always rebase on top of `main`.
- Release branches are named `release/<series>`, e.g. `release/1.x`, `release/2.x`.
- Release branches contain fixes relevant to their specific release series and are never merged to `main`.
- Release branches always branch off their first major release tag. For example,
  the output of `git merge-base main release/2.x` must be a commit pointed to by tag `v2.0.0`.
- Release branches are created lazily, that is, only when the first fix needs to be applied and released
  for a specific release series.
- Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) -- those are picked up by the changelog generator.
- If there is a JIRA ticket related to the change, you should mention it in either the PR title or the commit(s),
  with the following format: `[TICKET_ID]`.
- Sign your [commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)
  and [tags](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-tags).
- Remove branches from the remote once you don't need them anymore.

## Publishing

### Versioning

The versioning scheme used is [SemVer AKA Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

### Making a new release

1. Make a branch based on `main` to prepare for release (`git checkout -b prepare-release/X.Y.Z`)
1. Run `sh scripts/update-versions.sh X.Y.Z` to update the versions of
   - all workspace member crates
   - `package.json`
   - `crypto-ffi/bindings/gradle.properties`
     Make sure the result of the script run is correct.
1. Generate the relevant changelog section:
   ```bash
   git cliff --bump --unreleased
   ```
   and add it to the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
   Make sure the version number generated by `git cliff` matches the release version.
1. If there are any release highlights, add them as the first subsection below release title:
   ```markdown
   ## v1.0.2 - 2024-08-16

   ### Highlights

   - foo
   - bar
   - baz
   ```
1. In [index.md](docs/index.md), copy the commented-out table row from the bottom of the file to the appropriate place
   in the table, ordering by version number, descending. Search and replace the first 5 occurrences of `x.x.x` with `X.Y.Z`.
1. Make sure the changes look reasonable and complete; you can use the previous release as a reference
1. Push your `prepare-release/X.Y.Z` branch and create a PR for it
1. Get it reviewed, then merge it into `main` and remove the `prepare-release/X.Y.Z` branch from the remote
1. Now, pull your local `main`: `git checkout main && git pull`
1. Create the release tag: `git tag -s vX.Y.Z`
1. Push the new tag: `git push origin tag vX.Y.Z`
1. Create a new release on github, copying the relevant section from `CHANGELOG.md`
1. Voil√†!

#### Consider when making a release from a release branch

1. Isolate the changes to [index.md](docs/index.md) and `CHANGELOG.md` from the release commit itself
1. After the release is finished, cherry-pick the changes to [index.md](docs/index.md) and `CHANGELOG.md` and get them into `main`
1. For release series `4.x` and newer, docs upload happens automatically.
   If you released from the series `3.x` or older, you need to trigger docs upload manually:
   1. On GitHub, go to the [docs workflow](https://github.com/wireapp/core-crypto/actions/workflows/docs.yml)
   1. Click the `Run workflow` button
   1. In the `Use workflow from` dropdown, choose `release/5.x`, in `Tag to checkout` provide your release tag

### Publishing Android / JVM bindings

Publishing Android / JVM bindings happens automatically by a github workflow when a release tag is pushed.

If you would like to publish the bindings to a local Maven cache, run:

```ignore
cd crypto-ffi/bindings
./gradlew :jvm:publishToMavenLocal
./gradlew :android:publishToMavenLocal
```

### Publishing JS / WASM bindings

Publishing JS / WASM bindings happens automatically by a github workflow when a release tag is pushed.

If you would like to publish to `@wireapp/core-crypto` manually, log into NPM and
just run `bun publish`.
