# CoreCrypto Interop Runner

This interop runner is to ensure that, additionally to our unit test suite (300+ tests at the time of writing), our
different targets can talk with each other!

## How it works

- It creates a `master` client that orchestrates the "other clients".
- The other clients are then created & spawned - with all the required setup for them to work, for instance, creating a
  WebDriver/ChromeDriver instance for the WASM bindings -
- Then `master` talks to the other clients via an IPC-like interface for the operations that we need and ensures their
  integrity.

In the future, once we add more complex, a star-shaped communication pattern will be used; i.e. each client among N
clients will roundtrip messages with all the other (N - 1) clients.
