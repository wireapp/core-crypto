## Parts

* CoreCrypto: Abstracts MLS & Proteus in a unified API
* CoreCryptoFFI: FFI bindings for iOS, Android and WASM
* Keystore: Encrypted Keystore powered by SQLCipher on all platforms except WASM. WASM uses an IndexedDB-backed, encrypted store with AES256-GCM
* MlsProvider: RustCrypto + Keystore MLS provider

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Usage

### [API Docs](https://wireapp.github.io/core-crypto/core_crypto/)

## Building

### General Requirements

- rust: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- cargo-make: [https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/)

### Android

Install Android SDK and Build-Tools for API level 30+

> [!important]
> If you are building on macOS you'll need to setup `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` path variable manually:
> ```ignore
> export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=~/Android/Sdk
> ```

Install android rust targets:
```ignore
rustup target add x86_64-linux-android aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android
```
Build:
```ignore
cd crypto-ffi
cargo make android
cd bindings
./gradlew android:build
```

### iOS

Install Xcode & its command-line tools: [https://developer.apple.com/xcode/](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

Install iOS rust targets:
```ignore
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim
```

Build:
```ignore
cd crypto-ffi
cargo make ios
# Additionally, if you want to export a .XCFramework:
cargo make ios-create-xcframework
```

### MacOS

Install macOS rust targets:
```ignore
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### Linux

> [!note]
> If cross-compiling from macOS, you'll need to install
> [https://github.com/messense/homebrew-macos-cross-toolchains](https://github.com/messense/homebrew-macos-cross-toolchains).

Install Linux targets:
```ignore
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### WASM

Make sure you have all prerequisites:
* Install [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/)
* Install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` toolchain: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
* Install node.js (recommended way is via [Volta](https://volta.sh/))
* Install Bun (follow the instructions on [Bun's website](https://bun.sh/))

Build:
```ignore
cd crypto-ffi
cargo make wasm
```

### Bindings

Build bindings for Android, JVM, iOS and WASM

```ignore
cd crypto-ffi

# builds bindings and targets for the JVM (macOS / Linux)
cargo make jvm

# builds bindings and targets for Android
cargo make android

# builds iOS framework
cargo make ios-create-xcframework

# builds wasm binary & TS bindings
cargo make wasm
```

## Testing

### General testing

```ignore
# Install cargo-nextest if you haven't done so, it yields some substantial speedup
cargo install cargo-nextest
cargo nextest run
```

#### Run core crypto tests on WASM target

If you haven't already, install the target and wasm-pack:

```ignore
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-pack
```

If you want to test for chrome, [get chromedriver](https://getwebdriver.com/chromedriver) or the webdriver for the
browser you want to test for, respectively.

Then, to run tests for a crate in the workspace do

```ignore
wasm-pack test --headless --chrome ./<crate-folder-to-test>
```

#### Addendum: testing all ciphersuites

> [!warning]
> This takes quite a while.

```ignore
cargo nextest run --features test-all-cipher
```

### Platform-specific testing

### Kotlin/Android

* Take the steps to compile for Kotlin/Android
* Then:
```ignore
cd crypto-ffi/bindings
./gradlew test
```

### Swift/iOS

*No E2E testing is available as of now on Swift.*

### WASM/Web

* Take the steps to compile for WASM/Web
* Then:
```ignore
cd crypto-ffi
bun test
```

## Benchmarks
There are benches implemented in [`crypto/benches`](crypto/benches/) for several operations on mls groups with varying sizes or proteus.
Parameters like minimum or maximum group sizes and step sizes are defined in [`crypto/benches/utils/mod.rs`](crypto/benches/utils/mod.rs).

### Executing Benches
To execute the benches, e.g. for creating commits, run
```bash
cargo bench --bench=commit -- --quick
```
where `commit` is the name of the bench specified in [`crypto/Cargo.toml`](crypto/Cargo.toml), and the corresponding file in [`crypto/benches`](crypto/benches/).
In case you're interested in higher accuracy, and willing to trade it for execution speed, omit the `--quick` flag.
If you need reporting plots, remove the `.without_plots()` call in  [`crypto/benches/utils/mod.rs`](crypto/benches/utils/mod.rs).
The reports generated by criterion will be located in `target/criterion`.

## Git workflow

* The `main` branch is used as the everyday development branch.
* No merge commits. Always rebase on top of `main`.
* Release branches are named `release/<series>`, e.g. `release/1.x`, `release/2.x`.
* Release branches contain fixes relevant to their specific release series and are never merged to `main`.
* Release branches always branch off their first major release tag. For example,
  the output of `git merge-base main release/2.x` must be a commit pointed to by tag `v2.0.0`.
* Release branches are created lazily, that is, only when the first fix needs to be applied and released
  for a specific release series.
* Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) -- those are picked up by the changelog generator.
* If there is a JIRA ticket related to the change, you should mention it in either the PR title or the commit(s),
  with the following format: `[TICKET_ID]`.
* Sign your [commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)
  and [tags](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-tags).
* Remove branches from the remote once you don't need them anymore.


## Publishing

### Versioning

The versioning scheme used is [SemVer AKA Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

### Making a new release

1. Make a branch based on `main` to prepare for release (`git checkout -b prepare-release/X.Y.Z`)
1. Run `cargo xtask release bump [major|minor|patch|rc|pre] --dry-run`, check if it's the expected result
1. If all seems fine, re-run the previous command without the `--dry-run` argument.
   This will bump the versions of:
    - all workspace member crates
    - `package.json`
    - `crypto-ffi/bindings/gradle.properties`
1. Generate the relevant changelog section:
   ```bash
   git cliff --bump --unreleased
   ```
   and add it to the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
   Make sure the version number generated by `git cliff` matches the release version.
1. If there are any release highlights, add them as the first subsection below release title:
   ```markdown
   ## v1.0.2 - 2024-08-16

   ### Highlights

   - foo
   - bar
   - baz
   ```
1. Make sure the changes look reasonable and complete; you can use the previous release as a reference
1. Push your `prepare-release/X.Y.Z` branch and create a PR for it
1. Get it reviewed, then merge it into `main` and remove the `prepare-release/X.Y.Z` branch from the remote
1. Now, pull your local `main`: `git checkout main && git pull`
1. Create the release tag: `git tag -s vX.Y.Z`
1. Push the new tag: `git push origin tag vX.Y.Z`
1. Create a new release on github, copying the relevant section from `CHANGELOG.md`
1. Voil√†!


### Publishing Android / JVM bindings

Publishing Android / JVM bindings happens automatically by a github workflow when a release tag is pushed.

If you would like to publish the bindings to a local maven cache, run:
```ignore
cd crypto-ffi/bindings/android
./gradlew :jvm:publishToMavenLocal
./gradlew :android:publishToMavenLocal
```

### Publishing JS / WASM bindings

Publishing JS / WASM bindings happens automatically by a github workflow when a release tag is pushed.

If you would like to publish to `@wireapp/core-crypto` manually, log into NPM and
just run `npm publish`.
