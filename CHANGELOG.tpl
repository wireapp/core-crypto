# Changelog

Platform support legends:

* ✅ = tier 1 support. Things just work.
* ⚠️ = tier 2 support. Things compile but *might* not work as expected. Basically works but with papercuts
    * Note: the papercuts will majorly be with the build process. Things might be very rough to integrate as no polish at all has been given yet.
* ❌ = tier 3 support. It doesn't work just yet, but we plan to make it work.

This second major release focuses on expanding our platform support and featureset

Platform support status:

* x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu ✅
* x86_64-apple-darwin ✅
* x86_64-pc-windows-msvc ❌
* armv7-linux-androideabi ✅ (⚠️)

* wasm32-unknown-unknown ✅

Note: all the platforms marked with (⚠️) above will get a round of polish for the build process & documentation in the next release.

### CoreCrypto

* Majorly improved documentation across all crates. Documentation for the `main` branch can be found here. The `HEAD` of this branch should only be a tagged version.
    * This documentation is available here: <https://wireapp.github.io/core-crypto/core_crypto/>
* Moved the codebase to `async`
    * This was a requirement to make everything work on the WASM target, as we cannot block the JavaScript runtime without making the browsers freeze up completely
    * As a consequence, we forked `openmls` to [wireapp/openmls](https://github.com/wireapp/openmls)
        * Our incremental changes, including the `async` rewrite of `openmls` is located [here](https://github.com/wireapp/openmls/pull/4)
* Added support for MLS Group Persistence, as this was preventing clients from continuing use of their joined groups (oops!)
* **All methods creating a commit e.g. `add_clients_to_conversation` now require to call `commit_accepted` when Delivery Service responds `200 OK`. Otherwise, it might indicate there was a `409 CONFLICT`, i.e. another client sent a commit for current epoch before and got accepted. In that case, do nothing and let things get reconciled in `decrypt_message`**
* Added support for lifetime-expired Keypackage pruning
* Added support for external CSPRNG entropy pool seeding
* Dropped the `openmls-rust-crypto-provider` in favour of our `mls-crypto-provider` with support for more ciphersuites and updated dependencies
    * As a consequence, we forked `hpke-rs` to [wireapp/hpke-rs](https://github.com/wireapp/hpke-rs)
        * Our changes can be found [here](https://github.com/wireapp/hpke-rs/tree/fix/updated-deps)
    * Ciphersuite support details:
        * `MLS_128_DHKEMX25519_AES128GCM_SHA256_Ed25519` ✅
        * `MLS_128_DHKEMP256_AES128GCM_SHA256_P256` ✅
        * `MLS_128_DHKEMX25519_CHACHA20POLY1305_SHA256_Ed25519` ✅
        * `MLS_256_DHKEMX448_AES256GCM_SHA512_Ed448` ❌
            * There is no suitable `ed448` rust crate yet
        * `MLS_256_DHKEMP521_AES256GCM_SHA512_P521` ❌
            * `p521` RustCrypto crate is a WIP and not ready just yet. It shouldn't take too long though.
        * `MLS_256_DHKEMX448_CHACHA20POLY1305_SHA512_Ed448` ❌
            * There is no suitable `ed448` rust crate yet
        * `MLS_256_DHKEMP384_AES256GCM_SHA384_P384` ✅

* Expanded the API to include:
    * Conversations:
        * Ability to wipe
        * Ability to leave
        * Ability to force clients to update their keying material (i.e. self-update)
    * Support for MLS proposals
        * Exposed methods to create `Add` / `Remove` / `Update` proposals
    * Support for MLS external commits
        * Added ability to export MLS Public Group State for a given conversation
            * A `PublicGroupState` is also returned everytime you create a commit. This comes from the need to keep the MLS Delivery Service up to date on the `PublicGroupState` so that external commits can be made by other clients.
        * Added support for creating an external commit to join a conversation (`join_by_external_commit`)
    * Support for MLS external Add (`new_external_add_proposal`) and Remove Proposal (`new_external_remove_proposal`).
    * Support for X.509 credentials
    * Added a commit delay hint to prevent clients from rushing to commit to the server - which would cause epoch conflicts and high load
        * Returned in `decrypt_message`
* Changed most `message` fields to be named `commit`, as this would cause less confusion for consumers. Those fields always contained MLS commits and should be treated as such.
* All commit methods now return a `CommitBundle` struct containing
      * the commit message
      * an optional `Welcome` if there were pending add proposals
      * a `PublicGroupState` to upload to the Delivery Service
    * `decrypt_message` now returns a `DecryptedMessage` struct containing:
      * an optional application message
      * optional pending proposals renewed for next epoch to fan out
      * a `is_active` boolean indicating if the decrypted commit message caused the client to be removed from the group
      * the aforementioned commit delay

### FFI

* Added WASM bindings support to target `wasm32-unknown-unknown` as a new tier 1 target.
    * Added a full-fledged TypeScript wrapper with a full documentation to abstract the wasm-specific issues.
    * This now means that CoreCrypto is also now a NPM package. It is currently published at [@otak/core-crypto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@otak/core-crypto)
* Incremental improvements to the Kotlin & Swift UniFFI bindings
    * Caught up the bindings' API to match our internal CoreCrypto APIs
* Added a C-FFI for maybe future work involving other targets than Kotlin & Swift


### Keystore

* Added support for WASM through an AES-GCM256-encrypted IndexedDB backend
    * This introduced a major refactoring to structure the code around having different backends depending on the platform.
