# CoreCrypto Interop Runner

This interop runner is to ensure that, additionally to our unit test suite (300+ tests at the time of writing), our different targets can talk with each other!

## How it works

* It creates a `master` client that orchestrates the "other clients".
* The other clients are then created & spawned - with all the required setup for them to work, for instance, creating a WebDriver/ChromeDriver instance for the WASM bindings -
* Then `master` talks to the other clients via an IPC-like interface for the operations that we need and ensures their integrity.

In the future, once we add more complex, a star-shaped communication pattern will be used; i.e. each client among N clients will roundtrip messages with all the other (N - 1) clients.
